What to implement:
- Graph types (directed, undirected, fast/with properties, maybe multigraph)

- Import
  - Pajek (woth/without properties)
  - Edge list
  
- Bacis graph stuff
  - List of nodes/edges
  - Number of nodes/eges
  - Add/Remove node/edge
  - Neighbors/degree (in, out, in+out)
  - Strongly/weakly connected
  
- Naloga1
  - Largest connected component
  - Network distances (90% of network distances is network diameter)
  - Node clustering coefitient
  - Harmonic mean distance

- Traversal
  - DFS (all neighbors, directed, reverse)
  - BFS (all neighbors, directed, reverse)

- Graph construction (for directed and undirected)
  - Erdoy Renyi
  - Fully connected
  - Preferential attachment

- Centrality
  - DegreeCentrality
  - Pagerank
  - BetweennesCentrality
  - Closeness centrality
  - ...
  
- Cycles:
  - All cycles
  - Minimum weigh cycle
   
- Paths
  - Shorthest path
  
- Naloga2
    - Centrality (Pagerank, Betweennes, degreeCentrality)
    - Power-law exponent
    - average degree?
    
- Naloga3
    - Graph Laplacian (matrix)
    - modularity communities (algorithm)
    - LFR benchmark graph
    - girvan newman (Finds communities in a graph )
