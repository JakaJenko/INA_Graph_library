What to implement:
- Graph types (directed, undirected, fast/with properties, maybe multigraph)

- Import
  - Pajek (woth/without properties)
  - Edge list
  
- Bacis graph stuff
  - List of nodes/edges
  - Number of nodes/eges
  - Add/Remove node/edge
  - Neighbors/degree (in, out, in+out)
  - Strongly/weakly connected
  - Average degree
  - Network distances - effective diameter (90% of network distances is network diameter)
  - Power-law exponent

- Components
  - Largest connected component

- Traversal
  - DFS (all neighbors, directed, reverse)
  - BFS (all neighbors, directed, reverse)

- Graph construction (for directed and undirected)
  - Erdoy Renyi
  - Fully connected
  - Preferential attachment

- Centrality
  - DegreeCentrality
  - Pagerank
  - BetweennesCentrality
  - Closeness centrality
  
- Clustering
  - node clustering coefficient
  - node harmonic mean distance
  
- Cycles:
  - All cycles
  - Minimum weigh cycle
   
- Paths
  - Shorthest path
    
- Liner algebra
  - Graph Laplacian (matrix)

- Community
  - modularity communities (algorithm)
  - LFR benchmark graph
  - girvan newman (Finds communities in a graph )
